This is simple game from old BASIC simple games,
I retyped it again by Lazarus free pascal, all source code can be opened by
Lazarus are contained in a .rar file, and also an .exe file.

The original game is written by "CREATIVE COMPUTING MORRISTOWN, NEW JESRSY" under one of traditional BASIC dialects, the BASIC of command line programming style.
 
The computer will shuffle cards and choose two cards, one with lower value and another with higher one, and it will wait you to guess if the third card will be between the values of the two cards, if you are right, you'll have more money in your balance equal to what you have bet with, if you was wrong, the amount you bet with will be taken from your balance.
 
The cards values are grading like this, from 2 to 10, then Jack, then Queen, then King, then the Ace card.    

The game was tested and ran under Linux Mint.
